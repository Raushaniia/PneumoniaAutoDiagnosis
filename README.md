Due to the spread of coronavirus in the world, the possibility of early diagnosis of pneumonia is becoming increasingly important. In addition, the epidemic highlighted a shortage of medical staff, so automatic pneumonia diagnostics could save specialists time and help the pandemic overcome.

As a possible solution of the pneumonia diagnostic problem, a “Pneumonia Auto diagnosis” web application can be implemented. This application will predict the positive or negative 
diagnostic result(“Status”) based on the patient's characteristics.
